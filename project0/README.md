### Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

# My project is a website about me. The website contain four different HTML pages:
- index.html: the main page of the website, contains a summary of what the website is about.
- projects.html: present my projects with short descriptions
- about.html: contains a brief intro about myself
- contact.html: shows contact form and contact information

*I used bootstrap and a modified version of it "mdbootsrap" to style my website*

*** Note that not all buttons are working and not all contact information are real ***
